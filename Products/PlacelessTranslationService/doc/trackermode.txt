Spec of the tracker mode

What's behind the scene
=======================

When developing i18n products or sites with ZPT i18n namespace usage,
or translating from Python, I didn't find a good solution or tool to
find the untranslated messages.

This new feature for the PlacelessTranslationService (PTS later in
this text) will add one more way to find untranslated keys.

How to use it
=============

Under the new "Tracker" tab on the PTS there's a form with all
controls to set the domain, start/stop recording, clear the recorded
msgids and, of course download or view the resulting files in the
standard gettext format (.po, .pot).

What changed in the PTS files
=============================

New files are :
---------------

Tracker.py -- The Tracker class, that supports most that has been
added.

www/manage_trackerForm.pt -- The ZMI side of the tracker.

tests/testTracker.py -- tests a standlone Tracker object and
interacting with a (patched) PTS

tests/framework.py -- Install and read doc from ZopeTestCase
http://zope.org/Members/shh/ZopeTestCase to guess what it does.

tests/runtest.sh and runtest.bat -- Test runner helper for unix and
Windows

tests/environ.sh.model environ.bat.model -- Test environment vars for
Unix and Window. Copy the file for your OS to environ.sh or
environ.bat then change the values in according to thei respective
comments.

Modified files :
----------------

PlacelessTranslationService.py -- Includes ZMI wrapper, patch to
translate(...) method.
